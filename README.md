# Tax-Calculator

A tax-calculator made purely with c#. I was provided a csv file with tax information from all 50 states in the united states. With try catch blocks I checked for any errors in the csv file and read it using a streamreader. I put all the information in a dictionary so it could be easily accessed and used a foreach loop and if else statements to calculate the taxes according a users income and what tax bracket they fall in.

The tax calculator has a verbose method and a silent method which both shows the users tax data. The verbose method provides further details on the users taxes while the silent method uses very minimal description.

I also incorporated a csv file that included employee information. For the employee csv file I used a loop to read each line in the text file and put the data into an array. I then displayed the data in the array to the console to show all the employee data.
